            <h2><b>Landslides analysis with Susceptibility Map</b></h2>



                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Landslides are natural disasters where masses of rock, soil, or debris move down a slope. They can be triggered by natural factors like heavy rainfall and earthquakes, or by human activities such as deforestation, mining, and construction. Understanding and predicting landslides are vital to protect people, buildings, and the environment. This is where susceptibility maps become essential. These maps show areas likely to experience landslides, helping communities prepare and reduce risks by highlighting where people, properties, and infrastructure are most vulnerable.
